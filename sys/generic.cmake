#
# Toolchain file for
#
# Generic build environment
#
# This is a generic template which probably will not work on your system out of the box. You should
# either modify it or override the variables via command line options to make it to
# work. Alternatively, have a look at the specialized toolchain files in this folder as they may
# give you a better starting point for your build environment.
#
# Notes:
#
#  * CMake format: Command line options (e.g. compiler flags) space separated, other kind
#    of lists semicolon separated.
#
#  * Variables containing library search paths are empty by default. The CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
#    environment variable should be set up correctly, so that CMake can find those libraries
#    automatically. If that is not the case, override those variables to add search paths
#    manually
