NOTE: The source presented here is based on XMLF90, Version 1.2g, but had
      been modified in order to eliminate a lot of memory leaks and a few bugs.
      Some function interfaces (especially those passing strings back) had
      been turned into subroutines to prevent memory leakage due to run-time
      created temporary variables. However, not all the code had been revisited,
      just the parts used in our code, so be cautios.
