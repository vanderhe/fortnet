Analysis
########

This part contains recipes for calculating additional properties like atomic
forces, based on a previously trained network using Fortnet. Accordingly, these
analysis options are carried out on the basis of a network potential that has
already been created.

Please note that the analysis options are exclusively available for non-training
runs, i.e. validations or predictions, and therefore require an established
network configuration file.
