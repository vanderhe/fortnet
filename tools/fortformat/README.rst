Installation
============

Please note, that this package has been tested for **Python 3.X**
support. It additionally needs Numerical Python (the Numpy module).

System install
--------------

You can install the script package via the standard 'python setup'
mechanism. If you want to install it system-wide into your normal
python installation, you simply issue::

  python setup.py install

with an appropriate level of permission.

Local install
-------------

Alternatively, you can install it locally in your home space, e.g.::

  python setup.py install --user

If the local python install directory is not in your path, you should
add this. For the bash shell you should include in .bashrc::

  export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/.local/bin
